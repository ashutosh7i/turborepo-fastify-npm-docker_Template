# Knowledge Transfer: Turborepo Fastify Shared Package Implementation

## Project Overview

This document covers the implementation of a shared Fastify package in a Turborepo monorepo template, enabling reusable Fastify server configurations across multiple microservices.

## Initial Codebase Analysis

- **Project Type**: Turborepo monorepo with Docker support
- **Current Stack**: Next.js frontend, Express.js backend, shared packages
- **Package Manager**: npm with workspaces
- **Build Tool**: Turborepo for orchestration and caching

## Problem Statement

Need to create a shared Fastify package that can be reused across multiple microservice apps without duplicating configuration code.

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Shared Fastify Package (`packages/fastify/`)

Created a reusable Fastify package with:

- Pre-configured Fastify server setup
- Common plugins (CORS, Helmet)
- TypeScript support
- Standardized server creation and startup functions

**Key Files:**

- `package.json` - Dependencies and build scripts
- `src/index.ts` - Main server creation utilities
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

### 2. Fastify App Implementation (`apps/fastify-api/`)

Created a new microservice that uses the shared package:

- Uses `@repo/fastify` for server setup
- Implements specific business logic routes
- Includes comprehensive testing
- Docker containerization support

## Implementation Details

### Shared Package Structure

```typescript
// packages/fastify/src/index.ts
export function createFastifyApp(options: FastifyAppOptions): FastifyInstance;
export function startFastifyServer(
  server: FastifyInstance,
  options
): Promise<void>;
export type { FastifyInstance, FastifyRequest, FastifyReply };
```

### App Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// apps/fastify-api/src/server.ts
import { createFastifyApp } from "@repo/fastify";

export const createServer = (): FastifyInstance => {
  const server = createFastifyApp({
    logger: true,
    cors: true,
    helmet: true,
  });

  // Add app-specific routes
  server.get("/health", async () => ({ status: "ok" }));

  return server;
};
```

## Docker Integration

- **Multi-stage builds** for optimized production images
- **Turborepo pruning** for minimal Docker contexts
- **Docker Compose** integration for orchestration
- **Network configuration** for service communication

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests** using Fastify's built-in injection
- **Jest configuration** using shared presets
- **Test coverage** for all endpoints

## Build and Development Workflow

### Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Run specific service in dev
turbo run dev --filter=fastify-api

# Test specific service
turbo run test --filter=fastify-api
```

### Docker Commands

```bash
# Build all services
docker-compose build

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Access services
# http://localhost:3000 - Next.js web
# http://localhost:3001 - Express API
# http://localhost:3002 - Fastify API
```

## Benefits Achieved

### For Microservices Architecture

- **Runtime Independence**: Each service builds to standalone artifacts
- **Consistent Configuration**: Standardized Fastify setup across services
- **DRY Principle**: No duplicated server configuration code
- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript interfaces and types

### For Development Experience

- **Faster Development**: Reusable server setup reduces boilerplate
- **Better Testing**: Consistent test patterns across services
- **Easy Maintenance**: Update Fastify version in one place
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new Fastify-based microservices

## Future Considerations

- **Deployment Strategy**: Each service deploys independently
- **Monitoring**: Shared logging and metrics patterns
- **Security**: Consistent security configurations
- **Performance**: Shared optimization strategies

## Key Learnings

1. **Monorepo Benefits**: Shared packages reduce code duplication while maintaining service independence
2. **Build-time vs Runtime**: Dependencies are resolved at build time, services run independently
3. **Industry Pattern**: This approach is used by major companies (Netflix, Uber, Google)
4. **Evolution Path**: Can transition from monorepo to fully independent services if needed

## Next Steps

- Add more Fastify plugins to shared package (swagger, rate limiting, etc.)
- Implement shared middleware patterns
- Add monitoring and observability features
- Create additional microservices using the shared
